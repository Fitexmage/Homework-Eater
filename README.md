Long long time ago, there was a story of the brute and bloody fighting between the legendary monster "HOMEWORK EATER" and PSU Students!
HOMEWORK EATER is usually appear in libraries and buildings quietly and sneakly at night.
It eats students' homework for living.
Its hobby is watching those poor PSU students who CAN NOT protect their homework and crying in class since they cannot turn in their homework and will FAIL the classes!
HOMEWORK EATER laughs and eats homework as snacks to watch that scenario happens everyday.

NOW, YOU GOT THE CHANCE TO BE THE LEGENDARY MONSTER!

YOUR JOB is to avoid those student in order to eat as much homework as POSSIBLE!
